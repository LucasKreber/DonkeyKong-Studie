IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TA OR INSTRUCTOR (WRONG UPLOAD DATE ON DESIGN REPORT FINAL DRAFT)
We were using our Design Report Final Draft as our template for Final Report Final Draft and by mistake we forgot to change its name. Therefore we uploaded Final Report Final Draft as Design Report Final Draft on December 16 with the commit number 4bed47eef44de31aa24d2995868e30e89494179c.
We did realize our error too late and could not figure out to revert it. Thus we deleted the old version and re-uploaded the old version from our local files.
The original upload commit is e87b30beebb017d0361f1662a2dffa2efbc36f12.
No change is happened on Design Report Final Draft; but if the instructor or TA wants to see the old file they can see it from the history of that file.
Steps for restoring the original file
1.	Click history button on the file page
2.	Click the first commit which is happened on December 2.
3.	Click view
