IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TA OR INSTRUCTOR

We were using our Design Report Final Draft as our template for Final Report Final Draft and by mistake we forgot to change its name. Moreover we uploaded Final Report Final Draft as Design Report Final Draft on Dec, 16 with the commit number 4bed47eef44de31aa24d2995868e30e89494179c.

We did realize our error too late and could not figure out a way to revert it. Thus we deleted the wrong version and re-uploaded the original version from our local files.

The original upload commit number is e87b30beebb017d0361f1662a2dffa2efbc36f12.
