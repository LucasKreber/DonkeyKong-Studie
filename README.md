# Description

For a group project we are going to implement well-known game Donkey Kong. As classic 1-Player Donkey Kong game, game user will try to
reach to the goal by trying not to lose 3 lives, otherwise he will lose and will start again. In this game there will be main enemy(CPU
controlled) which he will sent many obstacles to stop player. Obstacles can be destroyed by special hammers found in the game. Each hammer
hits to rolling enemy obstacles will give user bonus pionts also. For reaching the goal player have to use ladders or jump to other
platforms. We will add some new features including new obstacles even new characters, on the other hand we will increase quality of the
graphics. Our task is to create this game by Object Oriented Programming. We will implement this game by JAVA. Any further information
